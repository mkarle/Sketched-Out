Sketched-Out
============
Sketched Out is an Android game - a mix of Telephone and pictures.
One player receives a word to draw and passes to the next player who guesses what the word was.
After this player guesses, play proceeds to the next player who draws what was guessed.
The game goes on while the guesses and drawings get sillier.

This is a very early version.  It includes the base gameplay and history activities.
Much more work needs to be done on UI, changing the saved games from files to a database, and eventually multiplayer.
